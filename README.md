# example_recipe_website
Create an example webpage for recipes.

For all links, I ensured that a new tab is generated upon click. This is by design, to show off the ability to create links that open new tabs. If wanted, I could more easily have created links that only redirect the current tab. Closing uneeded tabs is recommended. I used flexbox to make the index page adjustable when resizing horizontally. I ensured the images and the text on the index page are available to be clicked for link redirection. I ensured hovering over images on index adds border to emphasize what is being selected. 

I included 3 recipes: french bread pizza, lasagna, and oatmeal. Many additional links to recipes and other pages could easily be added.

For each link, I included a webpage with an example image, introduction, list of ingredients (with one example link that could potentially be used for advertising) and list of steps. I also included a link to redirect user back to homepage. More elements and additional formatting could easily be added upon request.
