# example-website
Create an example webpage for recipes.

Use flexbox to make the index page adjustable when resizing horizontally. Ensure the images and the text on the index page are available to be clicked for link redirection. Ensure hovering over images on index adds border. 

Include 3 recipes (french bread pizza, lasagna, and oatmeal).

For all links, ensure that a new tab is generated. This is by design, to enable easy clicking from page to page. Closing uneeded tabs is recommended.

For each link, include a webpage with an example image, introduction, list of ingredients (with one example link that could potentially be used for advertising) and list of steps. Include a link to redirect owner back to homepage.
