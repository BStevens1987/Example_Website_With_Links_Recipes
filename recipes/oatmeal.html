    <h2>Oatmeal</h2>
    <p>I became obsessed with oatmeal in college (hello 2008) and havenâ€™t looked back since. While cooking oatmeal in the microwave is quick and easy, this stovetop oatmeal recipe is my go-to when I want a perfectly sweetened, fluffy bowl of oats.</p>
    <p><strong><em>The rundown:</em></strong> Simply combine oats, milk, banana, blueberries, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt on the stovetop. Bring to a boil and then turn down to low and let simmer for 3-5 minutes or until thickened.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oats:</strong> we used and recommend <a href="https://www.quakeroats.com/products/hot-cereals/old-fashioned-oats" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quaker Oats Old Fashioned</a>, but you can also use any other rolled or quick-cooking oats.</li>
      <li><strong>Almond milk:</strong> feel free to use any kind of milk.</li>
      <li><strong>Banana and blueberries: </strong> we used banana and blueberries as all-natural sweeteners.</li>
      <li><strong>Flavors:</strong> we added a little vanilla, cinnamon, and salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine all ingredients into a small saucepan and turn heat to medium/high.</li>
      <li>Bring to a boil. Then, turn the heat down to low/medium and continually stir for around 3-5 minutes as the oatmeal cooks and thickens.</li>
      <li>Once oatmeal is at the desired consistency, remove from heat, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
