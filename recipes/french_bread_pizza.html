    <h2>French Bread Pizza</h2>
    <p>If I could pick one meal that I am CONSTANTLY going to over and over, this is it! This meal is absolutely delicious! I can make it in under 10 minutes and my kids love it. I mean they really love it. And so do I! We can add in all of our own toppings which makes it different every single time we eat it. In fact, switching that up may be my favorite part. It gets my kids to try new things and then they end up loving it even more! We’ve used olives, pineapple, peppers, chicken, sausage, pepperoni, salami, bacon, and even more!</p>
    <p>The options for this pizza are endless! And not only that but I love that I don’t have to spend time making the crust! I just buy a loaf of french bread from the store, slice it up, and away we go. I mean on days that I am REALLY ambitious, I have cooked up my own french bread. But you definitely don’t have to do that! This meal also makes fantastic leftovers that we love eating up for lunch the next day! I seriously cannot get enough of this easy meal. Try it out! I know that we all get so busy so this is a great option for those on-the-go nights!</p>
