    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li><strong>Pizza sauce:</strong> While you can choose your favorite pizza sauce, I recommend <a href="https://www.campbells.com/prego/products/pizza-sauces/pizza-sauce-pizzeria-style-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prego Pizza Sauce Pizzeria Style.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Mozarrella Cheese:</strong> You can’t have a delicious pizza without cheese!</li>
      <li><strong>Optional toppings:</strong> Pepperoni, olives, tomatoes, and basil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prep and slice:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Slice the loaf of bread in half lengthwise. Lay the bread on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li><strong>Add sauce, cheese and toppings:</strong> Spread evenly with the pizza sauce, top with cheese and favorite toppings.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake and serve:</strong> Bake for 12-15 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Slice and serve.</li>
