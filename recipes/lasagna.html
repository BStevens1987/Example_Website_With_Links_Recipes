    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>I’m sure everyone has their own favorite go-to lasagna recipe, but I’d just like to offer that this really is The Best Lasagna Ever. Growing up, my mom and her friends used to make it for potlucks and gatherings.</p>
    <p>I’ve made this lasagna for various categories of humans since my mom first scribbled it down for me: men, women, Democrats, Republicans, scholars, and foreign dignitaries. I even donated two pans to a charity auction once. The overwhelming consensus has always been that it’s "The Best Lasagna Ever," which is precisely what I’ve been trying to tell you turkeys. So let’s get started!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.</li>
      <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
      <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> While you can use your favorite lasagna noodles, I recommend <a href="https://www.dececco.com/us_us/product/lasagne-no-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lasagne no. 1 noodles from De Cecco.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
      <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
      <li>Layer the lasagna.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
